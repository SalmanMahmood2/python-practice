# Unit 3 Chapter 7 Question 5 - Password Encryption
Create a program that takes a password string from the user and encrypts the letters to go up or down the alphabet using a triple-number key. The amount up or down for the encryption of the alphabetical characters will depend on the input from the user. 

## Input Specification
There will be 3 integer inputs for the encryption key, $A$, $B$, $C$, with specifications being -25 ≤ $A$,$B$,$C$ ≤ 25. 

## Output Specification
The output will be the encrypted password.

## Sample Input
```
Chicken Egg
1
2
-3
```

## Output for Sample Input
```
Djfdmbo Gdh
```

## Explanation for Output for Sample Input
Using the keys provided `1`, `2` and `-3`, we cycle through each key. C up `1` to D, H up `2` to J, I down `3` to F, then C up `1` to D, K up `2` to M, E down `3` to B, and N up `1` to O. Thus the encryption becomes `Djfdmbo Gdh`.
