# Unit 4 Chapter 1 Question 1 - Grocery Stock List
A grocery store needs to track whether their specific apple types are in stock. 

Create a program that first, as the manager, takes in all the types of apples in stock in the morning.
After, as the customer, you need to be able to search for a specific apple, where it tells them whether itâ€™s in stock or not.

## Input Specification
The first part of the program will repeatedly ask for a type of apple to add to stock. Every line should add to a list, until a blank input is given, to which the program will then enter the next part.
The second part will repeatedly ask for a specific item to search. When a blank input is given, the program will end.

## Output Specification
Once the program enters the second part, it will respond to each input with either `In stock!` or `Not in stock!` depending on if the item was inputted during the first part of the program or not.

## Sample Input
```
